# Volcanic Eruption Patterns in the Americas

This Jupyter notebook presents a comprehensive analysis of volcanic eruption trends in Northern and Southern America. It explores regional and chronological distributions and investigates multiple geological and demographic factors affecting volcanic activity.

Regions analyzed include:
- **Northern America:** USA, Canada, Mexico  
- **Southern America:** Argentina, Chile, Chile-Argentina, Chile-Bolivia, Chile-Peru, Colombia, Colombia-Ecuador, Ecuador, Peru


## It includes:

- **Geospatial Visualization:** Interactive maps of volcano locations using Basemap.
- **Volcano Typology:** Pie charts by country showing dominant volcano types.
- **Eruption Frequency:** Bar charts by subregion.
- **Temporal Trends:** Scatter plots and histograms exploring elevation, eruption year, and population exposure.
- **Population Risk:** Box plots showing population proximity to volcanoes.
- **Correlation Analysis:** VEI (Volcanic Explosivity Index) vs. geographic location.

## Key Insights

Stratovolcanoes dominate both continents, particularly in the Andes and Cascade regions.

The Andes region in Southern America shows the highest eruption frequency over time.

Several volcanoes have populations exceeding 100,000+ within a 100 km radius.

Weak to moderate correlations between eruption explosivity (VEI) and geographic coordinates.
